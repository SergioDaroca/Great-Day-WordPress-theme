# Great Day - A WordPress theme
Great Day is a child theme for the fantastic Hitchcock WordPress theme from Anders Nor√©n.

It's also the title of the first -and lost- short movie of Alfred Hitchcok.

I created this for my friend Daniel cuberta's website at http://danielcuberta.com.

Cause he makes movies. Very good movies. And he writes, too. Brilliantly.

So we wanted a very minimal and clean style with easy video lists and neat, readable typography.

And you can do whatever you want with it!

Have a Great Day!
