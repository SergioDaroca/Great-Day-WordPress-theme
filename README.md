# Great Day - A WordPress theme
Great Day is a child theme for the fantastic Hitchcock WordPress theme from Anders Nor√©n.

**The Great Day** is a 1920 British short drama film directed by Hugh Ford. Alfred Hitchcock is credited as a title designer. The film is now considered to be a lost film. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Day

I created this for my friend Daniel Cuberta. His website is at http://www.danielcuberta.com.

Cause he makes movies. Very good movies. And he writes, too. Brilliantly.

So we wanted a very minimal and clean style with easy video lists and neat, readable typography.

And you can do whatever you want with it!

Have a Great Day!
